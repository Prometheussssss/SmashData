Project Overview

This project aims to create an interactive visualization platform that demystifies tennis analytics, making it accessible to a broader audience. We analyze factors such as:

Betting accuracy and market predictions

Surface-specific performance trends

Player career trajectories and major interruptions (injuries, pregnancies, etc.)

Rivalries and head-to-head comparisons

Geographic and climate influences on performance

Gender-based performance differences

By leveraging rich datasets and interactive data visualizations, this project seeks to provide both casual fans and analysts with new insights into the world of professional tennis.
